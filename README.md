# Doxxing Risk Calculator

This project is made to check whether someone can be doxxed or not. The program checks if any important information that you have has been posted on Twitter and lets you know. When the user enters their username for the social media platform, the Twitter API is used to search for keywords, and a threat level is calculated based on the global average. Finally, the information is presented to the user along with a threat level, which helps them determine how secure they are online.
